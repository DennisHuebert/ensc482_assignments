This folder contains my submission for assignment 3.

Each problem is in its own directory and is meant to be run on linux.

to compile problem1 run in the correct directory:
g++ problem1.cpp -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o problem1

to compile problem2 run in the correct directory:
g++ problem2.cpp -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o problem2

to compile problem1 run in the correct directory:
g++ problem3.cpp -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o problem3

For problem 1 hold space bar to see clustering
For problem 2 press space bar once to cluster and then press enter 
Do the same as for problem 2 for problem 3 but you enter x and y corredinates for user input data first

Screenshots for all problems are located in the Screenshots directory

Report is labeled report
