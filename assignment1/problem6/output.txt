~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Prisonder's Dilemma ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input payoff matrix is:

               Player 2
Player 1  | NC      |   C
       NC | -2, -2  | -10, -1
       C  | -1, -10 | -5, -5

The best outcome jointly for both players is for them to both not confess.
